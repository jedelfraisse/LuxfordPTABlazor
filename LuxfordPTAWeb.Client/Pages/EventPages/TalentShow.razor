                            <strong>Decide the Format:</strong><br />
                            Will it be a competition with prizes or a showcase just for fun? This affects judging, promotion, and audience expectations.

                            Choose a location that suits your audience size and technical needs (e.g., stage, sound system). Give yourself plenty of lead time—ideally a few months.
