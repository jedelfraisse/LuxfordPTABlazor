# Board Position Management Button Fix

## Issue Resolved
The "Add New Position Title" button was missing from the Admin Dashboard because it was only visible for **Future Year** school years, not for **Current Year** school years.

## Root Cause
The button visibility was controlled by this condition:
```csharp
private bool CanAddNewPositionTitles => SchoolYear?.Status is SchoolYearStatus.FutureYear;
```

This meant that during the current school year, administrators couldn't add new board positions when needed.

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Updated Permission Logic**
Changed the `CanAddNewPositionTitles` property to allow adding positions for both Current and Future years:
```csharp
// Before (restrictive)
private bool CanAddNewPositionTitles => SchoolYear?.Status is SchoolYearStatus.FutureYear;

// After (more flexible)
private bool CanAddNewPositionTitles => SchoolYear?.Status is SchoolYearStatus.FutureYear or SchoolYearStatus.CurrentYear;
```

### 2. **Enhanced UI Visibility**
- **Improved Toggle**: Made the "Show All Positions" checkbox more prominent with better styling and description
- **Relocated Button**: Moved the "Add New Position" button to the top-right area for better visibility
- **Better Labeling**: Enhanced the checkbox label to clearly indicate it enables management options

### 3. **UI Improvements Made**

#### Enhanced Toggle Section
```razor
<div class="form-check form-switch">
    <InputCheckbox @bind-Value="boardShowAllPositions" @onchange="OnBoardShowAllPositionsChanged" 
                   id="showAllPositions" class="form-check-input"></InputCheckbox>
    <label for="showAllPositions" class="form-check-label fw-bold">
        Show All Positions & Management Options
    </label>
    <div class="form-text">Enable to view all positions and access editing features</div>
</div>
```

#### Prominent Add Button
```razor
<div class="col-md-4 text-end">
    @if (boardShowAllPositions && CanAddNewPositionTitles)
    {
        <button class="btn btn-success btn-sm" @onclick="ShowAddTitleForm">
            <i class="bi bi-plus-circle"></i> Add New Position
        </button>
    }
</div>
```
