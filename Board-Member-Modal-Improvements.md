# Board Member Modal Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the board member details modal on the Home page with improved scrolling behavior and tab navigation for better user experience.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Fixed Header Design
- **Modal Header**: Now stays fixed at the top while content scrolls
- **Member Information**: Role title and member name remain visible at all times
- **Clean Layout**: Improved visual hierarchy with role title and member name

### 2. Intelligent Tab System
- **Conditional Tabs**: Tabs only appear when both position description AND bio are available
- **Smart Defaults**: 
  - If both exist ? Shows position tab first
  - If only one exists ? Shows single content view
  - If neither exists ? Shows appropriate "no information" message

### 3. Scrollable Content Areas
- **Targeted Scrolling**: Only the content paragraphs scroll, not the entire modal
- **Max Height**: Content areas limited to 300px height with smooth scrolling
- **Custom Scrollbars**: Styled scrollbars for better visual appearance
- **Proper Padding**: Added padding-right to prevent content being hidden behind scrollbar

### 4. Enhanced UI Elements

#### Tab Navigation
- **Bootstrap Tabs**: Clean, professional tab design
- **Icons**: Meaningful icons for each tab (briefcase for position, person-lines for bio)
- **Active States**: Clear visual indication of active tab
- **Responsive**: Full-width tabs that work on all screen sizes

#### Content Organization
- **Single View**: When only one type of content exists, shows without tabs
- **Dual View**: When both exist, uses tabbed interface
- **Empty State**: Professional message when no additional information is available

#### Visual Improvements
- **Modal Size**: Upgraded to `modal-lg` for better content display
- **Color Coding**: Consistent with existing design (info theme)
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy with proper headings and muted text
- **Spacing**: Proper padding and margins for readability

## Technical Implementation

### Tab State Management
```csharp
private string activeTab = "position"; // Default to position tab

private void SetActiveTab(string tab)
{
    activeTab = tab;
    StateHasChanged();
}
```

### Smart Content Detection
```csharp
bool hasPositionDescription = !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(selectedMember.RoleDescription);
bool hasBio = !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(selectedMember.Bio);
bool showTabs = hasPositionDescription && hasBio;
```

### Scrollable Content Areas
```css
.scrollable-content {
    max-height: 300px; 
    overflow-y: auto; 
    padding-right: 8px;
}
```

## User Experience Benefits
