# Public-Safe Board Member DTO Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a DTO (Data Transfer Object) pattern for the `BoardPosition.AssignedUser` that only exposes public-safe information while keeping private user data secure.

## What Was Created

### 1. Enhanced AssignedUserDTO (`LuxfordPTAWeb.Shared/DTOs/AssignedUserDTO.cs`)
- **Public-Safe Properties**:
  - `FullName` - User's full name for display
  - `PreferredName` - How they want to be addressed publicly
  - `Bio` - Public bio information
  - `RoleTitle` - Board position title
  - `RoleDescription` - Position duties description
  - `IsVotingMember` - Voting status
  - `SchoolYearLabel` - Year label
  - `SortOrder` - Display ordering
  - `ProfilePictureUrl` - Public profile picture

- **Computed Properties**:
  - `DisplayName` - Prefers PreferredName over FullName
  - `HasAdditionalDetails` - Whether to show "more info" button

### 2. Extension Methods for Easy Conversion
- `ToAssignedUserDTO()` - Converts single BoardPosition to DTO
- `ToAssignedUserDTOs()` - Converts collection and filters out unassigned positions

### 3. New Public API Endpoints (`BoardPositionsController.cs`)
- `GET /api/boardpositions/public/by-schoolyear/{id}` - Public board members for specific year
- `GET /api/boardpositions/public/current` - Public board members for current year
- Existing admin endpoints still return full models with all information

### 4. Updated Home Page (`Home.razor`)
- Now uses public API endpoint instead of admin endpoint
- Works with AssignedUserDTO instead of full models
- No private information is transmitted to the client

## Private Information Excluded from Public DTO
- ? Email addresses (User.Email)
- ? Phone numbers (User.PhoneNumber)  
- ? Physical address (Address, City, State, ZipCode)
- ? Join date (JoinDate)
- ? Volunteer preferences and availability
- ? Background check status
- ? Communication preferences
- ? Skills and volunteer interests
- ? Teacher/Staff/Parent status
- ? Any sensitive Identity information

## Benefits of This Approach

### Security
- **Prevents Data Exposure**: Private information never leaves the server for public endpoints
- **Type Safety**: Compiler prevents accidentally returning full models to public endpoints
- **Clear Separation**: Obvious distinction between public and private information

### Performance
- **Smaller Payloads**: Only necessary data is transmitted
- **Reduced Network Traffic**: DTOs are much smaller than full models

### Maintainability
- **Single Source of Truth**: All public user information comes through the DTO
- **Easy to Audit**: Simple to see what information is public
- **Consistent Pattern**: Can be extended to other entities (Events, Sponsors, etc.)

## Usage Examples

### For Public Endpoints (Controller)
```csharp
[HttpGet("public/board-members")]
public async Task<IEnumerable<AssignedUserDTO>> GetPublicBoardMembers()
{
    var positions = await _db.BoardPositions
        .Include(bp => bp.AssignedUser)
        .Include(bp => bp.BoardPositionTitle)
        .Where(bp => bp.AssignedUser != null)
        .ToListAsync();
        
    return positions.ToAssignedUserDTOs();
}
```

### For Blazor Components
```csharp
// Public information only
var publicMembers = await Http.GetFromJsonAsync<List<AssignedUserDTO>>("api/boardpositions/public/current");

// Admin information (full models)
var adminMembers = await Http.GetFromJsonAsync<List<BoardPosition>>("api/boardpositions/all-by-schoolyear/5");
```

### Role-Based Access
```csharp
// Return DTO for public users, full model for admins
var memberInfo = isPublicUser 
    ? position.ToAssignedUserDTO() 
    : position; // Full model with private info
```

## Extending the Pattern

This same pattern can be applied to other entities:

- **EventCoordinatorDTO** - For public event coordinator information
- **VolunteerDTO** - For public volunteer information  
- **SponsorContactDTO** - For public sponsor contact information

Each DTO should only include fields appropriate for public viewing, maintaining the security and privacy of your users while providing the necessary information for public display.

## Files Modified/Created
- ? Enhanced: `LuxfordPTAWeb.Shared/DTOs/AssignedUserDTO.cs`
- ? Updated: `LuxfordPTAWeb/Controllers/BoardPositionsController.cs`
- ? Updated: `LuxfordPTAWeb.Client/Pages/Home.razor`
- ? Created: `LuxfordPTAWeb.Shared/Services/UserDTOService.cs` (example service)
- ? All builds pass successfully

Your public users now only see appropriate information while admin users continue to have access to full user details for management purposes.
